# ctf-tools
Tools and output from various Capture the Flag events.

Most of this is "CTF-quality" code, written in a hurry during timed events to satisfy a particular need and not cleaned up or otherwise improved once the event is over. Don't use this for anything important beyond understanding what I was working on during CTFs!
